# Code Validation

Hi Kilo Code agent! Whatever model you are using, make sure you validate the code you generated.

## Steps to Validate

Run these commands in sequence:
1. `pixi run fmt`: format your code. This ensures that the code written by human and by you (coding agent) are consistent, following the style that Zig has provided.
2. `pixi run lint-ci`: ensure no linter errors.
3. `pixi run lint-fix`: if there is any linter error, fix it with this command.
4. `pixi run lint-ci`: recheck again, maybe there are linter errors that need manual fix.
5. `pixi run test`: build the code, then run all unit tests. This ensures that the code you generate pass all the unit tests.

After the validation is finished, update the project tree structure and file descriptions in README.md if needed. This is to ensure we always have updated documentation.
